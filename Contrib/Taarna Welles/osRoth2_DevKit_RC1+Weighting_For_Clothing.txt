Hello Roth clothing creator,

I was not satisfied how the current Roth was weighted in the lower section.
Also, I always like to copy the weights of the avatar so weight values are close to the original..... moet betere zin worden.
It's the reason why I made some changes I can work with and hopefully you can use
this file as a template for your created clothing for Roth.

Enjoy!
