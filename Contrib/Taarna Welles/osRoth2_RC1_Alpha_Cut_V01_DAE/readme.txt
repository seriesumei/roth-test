DAE Exports based on osRoth2_DevKit_RC1_Alpha_Cut_V01.blend

I exported the original:
feet+nails (one piece 3 materials)
hand+nails (two pieces with one hand material and three materials for the nails and can be unlinked inworld)
           Nail unlink not recommended unless there is another purpose for the nails.
bento head (one material)

New:
Replacement Roth body file with one material per alpha cut (unlink inworld).
           Note only the lower body has been adjusted in osRoth2_DevKit_RC1_Alpha_Cut_V01.blend
           as compared to Roth RC#1 from osRoth2_CurrentRelease_DevKit_RC#1.blend


The why's:
You can rename each alpha cut in Blender but you have to upload all alpha cuts as "one mesh".
This means: after the upload, all alpha cuts will have the name of the main mesh, so you have to rename
them all per alpha cut inworld. This is a limitation we have to deal with in Opensim or Second Life.

I created a quick and dirty image how the alpha cuts need to be renamed as you can check with the original Roth avatar inworld.
See AlphacutnamesRoth.png

Important:
Never move the alpha cuts. It's hard to get them aligned again. One single change will be seen in the viewer for those who notice it.
